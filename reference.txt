x_i: x in int form
x_a: x as a string of hex char pairs
x_b: x in the form of bytes
x_s: x as an ASCII string

x_i = int(x_a, 16)
x_a = "{:x}".format(x_i)
x_a = binascii.hexlify(x_b)
x_b = binascii.unhexlify(x_a)
x_s = x_b.decode('utf-8')
x_b = x_s.encode('utf-8')

z_i = x_i ^ y_i
z is the XOR of x and y
